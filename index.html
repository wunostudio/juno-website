                <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How do I scan books?</h4>
                    <p>Simply open the app and point your camera at a bookshelf. The AR scanner will automatically detect book spines and barcodes. For best results, hold your phone steady and ensure good lighting.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How accurate are the price estimates?</h4>
                    <p>Price estimates are based on publicly available market data and should be used as a general guide only. Actual selling prices depend on book condition, edition, current market demand, and other factors.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Why wasn't my book recognized?</h4>
                    <p>Book recognition depends on text clarity, lighting conditions, and database coverage. Try scanning the ISBN barcode for more accurate results. Some older or rare books may not be in our database.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What does "Hit" mean?</h4>
                    <p>A "Hit" indicates a book with an estimated resale value above your minimum price threshold. You can adjust this threshold in the app settings.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Does the app work offline?</h4>
                    <p>The app requires an internet connection to look up book information and pricing data. Barcode scanning works offline, but you'll need connectivity to retrieve book details.</p>
                </div>
